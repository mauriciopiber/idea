# Ideas

Ideas is an initiative theory to explain the mechanism on how the system of life works.

The idea has strong fundamentals based on the work of philosophers:

- Emmanuel **Kant**
- Georg Wilhelm Friedrich **Hegel**
- Karl Heinrich **Marx**
- Edmund Gustav Albrecht **Husserl**

Their work inspire me.

I've worked on my own philosophy since I was 15 years old, and now finally I can represent it to the world as a scientific system.

What you're gonna to see can change the way to think. You're welcome to the biggest adventure of your life.
