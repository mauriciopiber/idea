# Ideas

Ideas is an initiative theory to explain the mechanism on how the system of life works.

The idea has strong fundamentals based on the work of philosophers:

- Emmanuel **Kant**
- Georg Wilhelm Friedrich **Hegel**
- Karl Heinrich **Marx**
- Edmund Gustav Albrecht **Husserl**

Their work inspire me.

I've worked on my own philosophy since I was 15 years old, and now finally I can represent it to the world as a scientific system.

What you're gonna to see can change the way to think. You're welcome to the biggest adventure of your life.

## Metaphysics

### Words

Our first element, our atoms are the words. Words are the labels that we give for things inside our existence.

Words = Elements = Atoms = Things = Concepts = Symbols.

This is the start of every language.

### Layers

Our layers of existence. There are four layers:

Each layer is a different ethical stratum.

Layer = Slice

We should not use the terms stages, phases, because every thing is a different thing.

One thing is exactly one thing.
